    <h2><center>Introduction to Virtual Reality (VR)</center></h2>
    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a groundbreaking technology that immerses users in a fully digital, computer-generated environment.
    By wearing a VR headset and sometimes additional accessories like hand controllers or haptic gloves,
    individuals can experience a simulated world that feels as though it exists in three dimensions.
    This interaction is achieved through the combination of visual, auditory, and sensory input,
    offering a feeling of presence and immersion that makes users feel as if they are physically present in the virtual environment.</p>

    <h3>Core Components of VR</h3>
    Hardware:

    Head-mounted Display (HMD): The most critical component, an HMD includes screens and lenses to display the virtual world and sensors to track head movement. Examples include the Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR.
 
    Controllers: These allow users to interact with the VR environment by replicating hand movements or providing button-based input.
 
    Tracking Systems: Sensors or cameras monitor user movements, enabling seamless interaction within the digital world.
