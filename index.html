    <h2>Introduction to Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
    <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a groundbreaking technology that immerses users in a fully digital, computer-generated environment.
         By wearing a VR headset and sometimes additional accessories like hand controllers or haptic gloves,
  individuals can experience a simulated world that feels as though it exists in three dimensions.
  This interaction is achieved through the combination of visual, auditory, and sensory input,
 offering a feeling of presence and immersion that makes users feel as if they are physically present in the virtual environment.</p>
